# 🤖 AI-Powered Personalized Wellness Assistant

A smart health companion that links skin condition detection with personalized diet and exercise guidance.


## ⚠️ Prototype Showcase

> **Important Note:** This repository contains a **high-fidelity visual prototype**. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application's user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and complete feature flow.
>
> The back-end logic, machine learning models (CNNs), and database are **not** implemented in this version. All data (diagnoses, recommendations, and charts) is currently **mocked** for demonstration purposes.

## 🧩 Problem & Solution

Current health apps are often siloed: skin-related apps focus only on detection, while fitness apps ignore underlying medical conditions.  
Our solution bridges this gap by providing a holistic, three-step wellness loop:

1. **Detect (Mocked):** The user uploads a skin image. The app (will) use a CNN model to diagnose the condition.  
2. **Recommend (Mocked):** Based on the diagnosis, the app generates personalized diet (eat/avoid), exercise, and lifestyle plans.  
3. **Track (Mocked):** The user tracks their progress, and the system's feedback loop (will) refine recommendations over time.
